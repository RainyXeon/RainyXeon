# Howdy my friend ðŸ‘‹

I'm **RainyXeon** (call me **rainy** because I love it), a full stack developer from Vietnam, a small country with technological prospects.
I started my software development journey in the mid-2020s with the dream of contributing to the open source community.

## Languages and tools that I know

### Programming language

I can do nearly everything, but I do best at `JavaScript (Vanilla / NodeJS)` and `Lua (Luvit / Vanilla)`.
I'm currently learning `Dart` for `Flutter`, `C`, `C#` and `Kotlin`.

### Databases

For databases, I mostly know `mongoDB`, `MySQL` and currently learning `PostgreSQL` and `SQlite`.
But to be honest, my favorite is `PostgreSQL`

### Frameworks

My knowledge about frameworks is wide, but good at `ExpressJS`, `ReactJS`, `NuxtJS` and a bit `NestJS`

And whenever possible, looking to learn more and more things. (Like Pedro)
